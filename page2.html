         <h2>School Life </h2>
         <p>*Growing up, I attended an elementary school based around science and technology. They selected me in second grade to learn how to code/program lego robots, set up and fix the projector/smartboards and help teachers around the school with tech related issues. Yes, a little second as tech support, running around the school! I can say that it sparked my interest in tech</p>
         <p>*High school was a great time for me. I attened,participated and volunteered in a lot of events relating to student culture, poetry, Black History month etc. I was able to become part of my school community, meet parents, new and prospective students and be one of the first called when my school needed a student representative.</p>
         <p>*Throughout highschool I took seven AP courses-Psychology, English Lang and Composition, English Literature, United States History, United States Government and Politics, Calculus, and Computer Science- to get a feel of college level classes. They have been the source of many sleepless nights, but at least now I know what expect and avoid in college</p>
