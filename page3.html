         <h2>Personal Life </h2>
         <p>*I am a Christian, I lOVE JESUS, and this has been my greatest influence thus far in life.</p>
         <p>*My love for fashion has allowed me to dabble in tailoring and upcycling clothing.</p>
         <p>*My fear of public speaking was conquered through high school due to being selected to read my poem during a BHM celebration as well as preaching at my church multiple times.</p>
         <p>*I learned to play the clarinet in second grade and continued to play it until eight grade. I loved my clarinet so much that I named it, but that name shall remain a mystery.</p>
         <p>*I've only been on a plane once to go to Disney World which was 9 years ago.</p>
         <p>* I LOVED MY Nintendo 3Ds growing up. Mario cart 7 was my favorite game to play on it. </p>
         <p>*Uno is my favorite party game but it is the source of many arguments and hurt feelings, but that makes it so much more fun!! </p>
