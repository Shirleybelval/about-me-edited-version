          <h2>Random Facts</h2>
          <p>*My dream vacation destinations are Greece, Kenya, and Barcelona due to beautiful scenery, culture and history.</P>
          <p>*I can speak Haitian Creole and English fluently as well as Spanish and French intermediately</P>
          <p>*I love to eat and try food from different cultures. By far the weirdest food I've tried is frog legs(it's honestly a cross between fish and chicken in taste and in texture) and bacon, egg and cheese flavored crickets from a museum (my friend didn't want to try it alone!)</p>
          <p>*My biggest fear growing up was the dark and public speaking, but high school helped me to conquer one of those fears.<p>
          <p>*I have a two year old puppy named Ella, who is a mixed breed-havanese and shih tzu </p>
          <p>*My favorite movie is "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". I literally watched it a month ago for a quick laugh!</p>
          <p>*Bad habit, but I can spend hours on YouTube watching hair, fashion and animal videos.<p>
